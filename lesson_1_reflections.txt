Using the Fc command showed me all the sections
that were different on one screen instead of me 
having to compere them line by line. This saved
a great deal of time. 

Having access to all the versions would help 
debugg it if an update starts causing bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: all your commits should be a logic points; you can ensure that multiple new changes are commited seperately

Cons: you may forget; user error;

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because git was designed for code which typically have multiple files for a single application. while google docs is more of a corlaboration tool for multiple people working on invdivual documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
to find unexecpted errors in new verions of code that were in the pervious.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
knowing that I would easliy be able to access the previsous verison would make it easier to creect a new bug making me less worriesome of trying more difficult improvements.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To make chaning my code less stressful.
